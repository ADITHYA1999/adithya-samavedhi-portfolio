I am currently working as a software developer at Goldman Sachs exploring cutting-edge technologies. My fascination for computer science opriginates from my passion to solve problems and puzzles. Something about our problem solcing ability as humans amazes me. For the same reason, I've continuously explored the field of machine learning in the hope to see if they could match human intelligence. In particular, the evolution of human communication has left me enthralled and I'm currently exploring natural language processing technologies to help computers mimic this.
